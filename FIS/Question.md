# Question 1 
 **Write a Python(3.6+) program which should read content from an input file and produce a text report containing the following information:**
* The total wordcount
* Total of unique words
* The top 10 words based on their word count, showing the word and how many times it appeared.
* The following should be noted.
* The program should have one mandatory parameter (the input file name). The program should stop and report an error if the mandatory parameter is not specified, or if the specified input file name does not exist. Sample input file attached for the reference. Program should work for any text file.
* It has 1 optional parameter (the output file name). if this is not specified, the output file produced should be hardcoded as “wc_report.txt”
* The program should ignore any punctuation, such as commas, full stops, quotation marks etc. It should only be counting words.
* Hyphenated (-) words should be treated as a single word.
* The “top 10” results should be shown in descending order based upon their word count.
* The program should be case insensitive. i.e. Hello and HELLO are counted as the same word.
# Sample Input file
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
