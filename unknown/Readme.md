Consider this please
Using either JavaScript or Python, write a prototype program for an ABM (automated banking machine).
The program should:
Define some sample account numbers, amounts, and security pin code for each account.
Ask the user for an account number (and check that it matches).
Ask the user for a security pin code (and check that it matches).
Provide instructions for the transactions (deposit, withdraw, and check balance) available to the user and how to select the option.
Perform the desired transaction and then output the new balance for the account.
BONUS - Implement multiple accounts for a user and transfer funds between accounts. HINT: This can be achieved using object oriented programming (classes and objects).
